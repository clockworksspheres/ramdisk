# Python State Machine UML

Python state machines can be implemented using libraries that closely align with UML State Machine concepts. One such library is `statesman`, which provides a declarative and simple API utilizing type hints, decorators, and enums to define states and events. It supports entry and exit actions for states, as well as guard, before, on, and after actions for events. Statesman is designed to be async-native, making it easy to integrate with long-running, event-driven processes.

Another library is `Miros`, a Python statechart library that allows you to quickly translate design goals into robust, understandable, working code. Miros is a hierarchical state machine (HSM) running within its own thread, which can be useful for complex state management in applications.

For a more traditional approach, you can use the `QStateMachine` class from the Qt for Python framework, which provides a hierarchical finite state machine based on UML Statecharts.

These libraries provide robust support for modeling data within the state machine class itself and passing external data into transitions, facilitating cleaner encapsulation and maintainability.

Additionally, the `uml-state-machine` GitHub topic lists several projects that implement UML State Machines in various programming languages, including Python. These projects often include features for visualization, simulation, and code generation for Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSMs) following the UML State Machine specification.

# python code

Certainly! Below is a simple example of a Python state machine using the `statesman` library. This example demonstrates a basic state machine with states and transitions, including entry and exit actions.

First, you need to install the `statesman` library. You can do this using pip:

```
pip install statesman 
```

Now, let's create a simple state machine for a traffic light system:

```
import statesman

# Define the states
class Red(statesman.State):
    pass

class Green(statesman.State):
    pass

class Yellow(statesman.State):
    pass

# Define the state machine
class TrafficLight(statesman.Machine):
    initial_state = Red

    def on_enter_red(self):
        print("Light turned Red")

    def on_exit_red(self):
        print("Light exiting Red")

    def on_enter_green(self):
        print("Light turned Green")

    def on_exit_green(self):
        print("Light exiting Green")

    def on_enter_yellow(self):
        print("Light turned Yellow")

    def on_exit_yellow(self):
        print("Light exiting Yellow")

# Define the transitions
TrafficLight.add_transition(Red, Green, name='turn_green')
TrafficLight.add_transition(Green, Yellow, name='turn_yellow')
TrafficLight.add_transition(Yellow, Red, name='turn_red')

# Create an instance of the state machine
light = TrafficLight()

# Transition the state machine
light.turn_green()  # Light turned Green
light.turn_yellow()  # Light turned Yellow
light.turn_red()  # Light turned Red 
```

## Explanation

1. **Define States**: We define the states `Red`, `Green`, and `Yellow` as subclasses of `statesman.State`.
    
2. **Define State Machine**: We create a `TrafficLight` class that inherits from `statesman.Machine`. We set the initial state to `Red`.
    
3. **Entry and Exit Actions**: We define methods for entry and exit actions for each state. These methods are called when the state machine enters or exits a state.
    
4. **Define Transitions**: We add transitions between the states using the `add_transition` method.
    
5. **Create and Transition**: We create an instance of the `TrafficLight` state machine and transition between states using the defined methods.
    

This example should give you a good starting point for implementing a state machine in Python using the `statesman` library. If you need more advanced features or different libraries, feel free to explore `Miros` or `QStateMachine` as mentioned earlier.

# without statesman

Certainly! Here's a simple implementation of a state machine in Python without using any external libraries. We'll create a traffic light state machine as an example.

## Traffic Light State Machine

```
class TrafficLight:
    def __init__(self):
        self.state = self.Red(self)

    def change_state(self, new_state):
        self.state = new_state

    class State:
        def __init__(self, traffic_light):
            self.traffic_light = traffic_light

        def change(self, new_state):
            self.traffic_light.change_state(new_state)

    class Red(State):
        def __init__(self, traffic_light):
            super().__init__(traffic_light)
            print("Light turned Red")

        def turn_green(self):
            print("Turning to Green")
            self.change(self.traffic_light.Green(self.traffic_light))

    class Green(State):
        def __init__(self, traffic_light):
            super().__init__(traffic_light)
            print("Light turned Green")

        def turn_yellow(self):
            print("Turning to Yellow")
            self.change(self.traffic_light.Yellow(self.traffic_light))

    class Yellow(State):
        def __init__(self, traffic_light):
            super().__init__(traffic_light)
            print("Light turned Yellow")

        def turn_red(self):
            print("Turning to Red")
            self.change(self.traffic_light.Red(self.traffic_light))

# Create an instance of the traffic light
light = TrafficLight()

# Transition the state machine
light.state.turn_green()  # Light turned Green
light.state.turn_yellow()  # Light turned Yellow
light.state.turn_red()  # Light turned Red 
```

## Explanation

1. **TrafficLight Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state machine with the `Red` state.
        
    - **`change_state`**: Method to change the current state.
        
2. **State Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state with a reference to the traffic light.
        
    - **`change`**: Method to change the state of the traffic light.
        
3. **Red, Green, Yellow Classes**:
    
    - Each state class inherits from the `State` class.
        
    - Each state class has an `__init__` method to print the current state.
        
    - Each state class has methods to transition to the next state (`turn_green`, `turn_yellow`, `turn_red`).
        
4. **Creating and Transitioning**:
    
    - An instance of the `TrafficLight` class is created.
        
    - The state machine transitions between states using the defined methods.
        

This implementation is a basic and self-contained example of a state machine in Python. You can expand it with more states and transitions as needed.

# generic state machine python

Certainly! Below is a generic state machine implementation in Python. This implementation is flexible and can be used for various state machine scenarios. It includes a base `State` class, a `StateMachine` class, and an example of how to use it for a traffic light system.

## Generic State Machine Implementation

```
class State:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = self.__class__.__name__

    def on_enter(self):
        """Called when the state is entered."""
        print(f"Entered state: {self.name}")

    def on_exit(self):
        """Called when the state is exited."""
        print(f"Exiting state: {self.name}")

    def handle_event(self, event):
        """Handle an event and return the next state."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement handle_event method")


class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.state.on_enter()

    def handle_event(self, event):
        """Handle an event and transition to the next state."""
        next_state = self.state.handle_event(event)
        if next_state is not None:
            self.state.on_exit()
            self.state = next_state
            self.state.on_enter()


# Example: Traffic Light State Machine

class Red(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_green':
            return Green()
        return None


class Green(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_yellow':
            return Yellow()
        return None


class Yellow(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_red':
            return Red()
        return None


# Create an instance of the state machine
traffic_light = StateMachine(Red())

# Transition the state machine
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_green')  # Entered state: Green
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_yellow')  # Entered state: Yellow
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_red')  # Entered state: Red 
```

## Explanation

1. **State Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state with a name derived from the class name.
        
    - **`on_enter`**: Method called when the state is entered.
        
    - **`on_exit`**: Method called when the state is exited.
        
    - **`handle_event`**: Method to handle an event and return the next state. This method must be implemented by subclasses.
        
2. **StateMachine Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state machine with an initial state and calls the `on_enter` method of the initial state.
        
    - **`handle_event`**: Handles an event by calling the `handle_event` method of the current state. If a new state is returned, it transitions to the new state and calls the `on_exit` and `on_enter` methods accordingly.
        
3. **Traffic Light States**:
    
    - **`Red`, `Green`, `Yellow`**: Subclasses of `State` that implement the `handle_event` method to define the transitions between states.
        
4. **Creating and Transitioning**:
    
    - An instance of the `StateMachine` class is created with the initial state `Red`.
        
    - The state machine transitions between states using the `handle_event` method with the appropriate events.
        

This generic implementation can be easily adapted to other state machine scenarios by defining new state classes and implementing the `handle_event` method to define the transitions.

# concrete state

Certainly! Let's create a more concrete example of a state machine in Python. We'll continue with the traffic light example, but this time, we'll make it more detailed and concrete by defining specific states and transitions.

## Concrete Traffic Light State Machine

```
class State:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def on_enter(self):
        """Called when the state is entered."""
        print(f"Entered state: {self.name}")

    def on_exit(self):
        """Called when the state is exited."""
        print(f"Exiting state: {self.name}")

    def handle_event(self, event):
        """Handle an event and return the next state."""
        raise NotImplementedError("Subclasses must implement handle_event method")


class StateMachine:
    def __init__(self, initial_state):
        self.state = initial_state
        self.state.on_enter()

    def handle_event(self, event):
        """Handle an event and transition to the next state."""
        next_state = self.state.handle_event(event)
        if next_state is not None:
            self.state.on_exit()
            self.state = next_state
            self.state.on_enter()


class Red(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_green':
            return Green('Green')
        return None


class Green(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_yellow':
            return Yellow('Yellow')
        return None


class Yellow(State):
    def handle_event(self, event):
        if event == 'turn_red':
            return Red('Red')
        return None


# Create an instance of the state machine
traffic_light = StateMachine(Red('Red'))

# Transition the state machine
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_green')  # Entered state: Green
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_yellow')  # Entered state: Yellow
traffic_light.handle_event('turn_red')  # Entered state: Red 
```

## Explanation

1. **State Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state with a name.
        
    - **`on_enter`**: Method called when the state is entered.
        
    - **`on_exit`**: Method called when the state is exited.
        
    - **`handle_event`**: Method to handle an event and return the next state. This method must be implemented by subclasses.
        
2. **StateMachine Class**:
    
    - **`__init__`**: Initializes the state machine with an initial state and calls the `on_enter` method of the initial state.
        
    - **`handle_event`**: Handles an event by calling the `handle_event` method of the current state. If a new state is returned, it transitions to the new state and calls the `on_exit` and `on_enter` methods accordingly.
        
3. **Concrete States**:
    
    - **`Red`, `Green`, `Yellow`**: Subclasses of `State` that implement the `handle_event` method to define the transitions between states.
        
    - Each state has a specific name and handles events to transition to the next state.
        
4. **Creating and Transitioning**:
    
    - An instance of the `StateMachine` class is created with the initial state `Red`.
        
    - The state machine transitions between states using the `handle_event` method with the appropriate events.
        

This implementation is concrete and can be easily adapted to other state machine scenarios by defining new state classes and implementing the `handle_event` method to define the transitions.

## Explanation

1. **State Class**:
    
    - **Attributes**:
        
        - `name: str`: The name of the state.
            
    - **Methods**:
        
        - `on_enter()`: Called when the state is entered.
            
        - `on_exit()`: Called when the state is exited.
            
        - `handle_event(event: str)`: Handles an event and returns the next state. This method must be implemented by subclasses.
            
2. **Red Class**:
    
    - **Methods**:
        
        - `handle_event(event: str)`: Handles the `turn_green` event and transitions to the `Green` state.
            
3. **Green Class**:
    
    - **Methods**:
        
        - `handle_event(event: str)`: Handles the `turn_yellow` event and transitions to the `Yellow` state.
            
4. **Yellow Class**:
    
    - **Methods**:
        
        - `handle_event(event: str)`: Handles the `turn_red` event and transitions to the `Red` state.
            
5. **StateMachine Class**:
    
    - **Attributes**:
        
        - `state: State`: The current state of the state machine.
            
    - **Methods**:
        
        - `__init__(initial_state: State)`: Initializes the state machine with an initial state and calls the `on_enter` method of the initial state.
            
        - `handle_event(event: str)`: Handles an event by calling the `handle_event` method of the current state. If a new state is returned, it transitions to the new state and calls the `on_exit` and `on_enter` methods accordingly.
            

## Relationships

- **Inheritance**:
    
    - `Red`, `Green`, and `Yellow` inherit from `State`.
        
- **Association**:
    
    - `StateMachine` has a one-to-one association with `State`.

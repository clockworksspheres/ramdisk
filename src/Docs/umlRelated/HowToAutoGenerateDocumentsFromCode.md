# Generate Documents from Code

Generating documents from code can be achieved through various tools and methods. One approach is to use a documentation generator tool that can extract documentation from source code and generate it in a structured format such as HTML, PDF, or LaTeX. For example, Doxygen is a documentation generator tool that can extract documentation from source code and other documentation files and generate it in a structured format.

Another method involves programmatically creating new documents using Visual Studio. You can create a new Microsoft Word document programmatically from Visual Basic or C# in Visual Studio by using the default template or with a custom template.

Amazon Q Developer is another tool that can help generate documentation by analyzing your project, code objects, and dependencies within your codebase, and documenting complex coding concepts.

Visual Expert is a tool that allows you to generate comprehensive source code documentation for languages like PowerBuilder, Oracle, and SQL Server. It supports four languages: English, French, Japanese, and Spanish.

Additionally, Docentric AX introduces new APIs that enable various scenarios for generating Word documents from templates as a binary or on both client and server.

Each of these methods and tools offers different features and capabilities, so the choice depends on your specific needs and the type of documentation you wish to generate.

# Does sphynx do this?

Found 9 relevant pages for: "Sphinx documentation generator capabilities and usage"

Sphinx is a powerful documentation generator primarily used by the Python community, though it can be applied to other environments as well. It converts reStructuredText files into various formats, including HTML, PDF, EPub, and more. Here are some key capabilities and usage details of Sphinx:

## Capabilities

- **Markup Languages**: Sphinx supports reStructuredText and MyST Markdown, allowing for the creation of highly structured technical documents with tables, highlighted code blocks, mathematical notations, and more.
    
- **Output Formats**: It can generate documentation in multiple formats such as HTML, LaTeX (for PDF), EPub, Texinfo, and manual pages.
    
- **Cross-References**: Sphinx enables the creation of cross-references within and across projects, including references to sections, figures, tables, citations, glossaries, and code objects.
    
- **Hierarchical Structure**: It allows for the easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents, and children.
    
- **Automatic Indices**: Sphinx generates a general index and a module index.
    
- **Code Highlighting**: It uses the Pygments highlighter for automatic code highlighting.
    
- **Templating**: HTML output is flexible using the Jinja 2 templating engine.
    
- **Extension Ecosystem**: Sphinx has a robust extension ecosystem, with numerous built-in and third-party extensions available for tasks like creating diagrams, testing code, and more.
    
- **API Documentation**: It can generate API documentation for Python, C++, and other software domains, either manually or automatically from docstrings.
    

## Usage

- **Installation**: Sphinx can be installed using pip. You will need a working installation of Python and pip.
    
    ``` bash
    pip install sphinx 
    ```
    

- **Quickstart**: To set up a new Sphinx project, you can use the `sphinx-quickstart` command, which will guide you through the initial setup.
    
    ``` bash
    sphinx-quickstart 
    ```
    
- During the setup, you can choose options such as the name of your master document, whether to use the `autodoc` extension, and whether to separate source and build directories.
    
- **Configuration**: The configuration file `conf.py` is where you set up various options for your Sphinx project, including extensions, themes, and output settings.
    
- **Building Documentation**: Once your project is set up, you can build the documentation using the `make` command.
    
    ``` bash
    make html 
    ```
    

- This will generate the HTML output in the `_build` directory.
    
- **Themes**: Sphinx provides several built-in themes, such as `alabaster`, `classic`, `sphinxdoc`, and `scrolls`. You can also use third-party themes or create your own.
    
- **Extensions**: To extend Sphinx's functionality, you can use built-in extensions like `autodoc` for automatic documentation from code, `doctest` for testing code snippets, and `intersphinx` for linking to other Sphinx projects. Third-party extensions can be installed via pip.
    

## Community and Support

- **Community**: Sphinx has an active community with numerous resources, tutorials, forums, and examples available.
    
- **Contribution**: The project welcomes contributions from anyone. You can contribute to the project by following the guidelines provided in the Sphinx contributors' guide.
    

For more detailed information and tutorials, you can refer to the official Sphinx documentation available at sphinx-doc.org.

# how to use doxygen

Found 6 relevant pages for: "Doxygen usage guide step-by-step"

To use Doxygen effectively, follow these step-by-step instructions:

1. **Document Your Source Code**: Add special documentation blocks to your source code. These blocks are used by Doxygen to generate the documentation. For example, you can place a documentation block in front of a class, function, or variable declaration. For more details, see the section on special documentation blocks.
    

- **Generate a Configuration File**: Create a configuration file for your project. This file determines all of Doxygen's settings. To generate a template configuration file, run the following command in the command line:
    
    ``` bash
    doxygen -g  
    ```
    

Replace `<filename>` with the desired name for your configuration file. If you omit the filename, a file named `Doxyfile` will be created. If a file with the same name already exists, it will be renamed to `<filename>.bak`.

- **Edit the Configuration File**: Open the generated configuration file in a text editor or use Doxywizard, a graphical front-end for editing the configuration file. Configure the settings to match your project's needs. Key settings include:
    
    - **INPUT**: Specify the root directory or directories of your source files.
        
    - **FILE_PATTERNS**: Add file patterns to specify which files to parse (e.g., `*.cpp`, `*.h`).
        
    - **RECURSIVE**: Set to `YES` for recursive parsing of source directories.
        
    - **EXCLUDE** and **EXCLUDE_PATTERNS**: Use these to exclude specific files or directories from parsing.
        

- **Generate the Documentation**: Run Doxygen with the configuration file to generate the documentation. Use the following command:
    
    ``` bash
    doxygen  
    ```
    

Replace `<filename>` with the name of your configuration file. Doxygen will create output directories (e.g., `html`, `latex`, `rtf`) inside the specified output directory, which by default is the directory where Doxygen is started.

- **View the Documentation**: The generated HTML documentation can be viewed by opening the `index.html` file in a web browser. For the best results, use a browser that supports cascading style sheets (CSS) and JavaScript.
    

- **Customize Output (Optional)**: You can customize the output by modifying the configuration file. For example, you can:
    
    - Set the `SOURCE_BROWSER` tag to `YES` to generate cross-references to source files.
        
    - Set the `INLINE_SOURCES` tag to `YES` to include source code directly in the documentation.
        
    - Generate LaTeX, RTF, XML, and other formats by setting the corresponding output tags.
        

- **Advanced Features (Optional)**: For more advanced features, such as generating a search engine or combining XML files, refer to the Doxygen manual and the sections on Doxysearch usage and XML output.
    

By following these steps, you can effectively use Doxygen to generate comprehensive documentation for your project.

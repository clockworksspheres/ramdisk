## Remount Folder to Another Location

To remount a drive to a different location on macOS, you can use the `diskutil` command in the Terminal. First, identify the drive's identifier using `diskutil list`, then unmount the drive with `diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX`, where `X` is the identifier of the drive. After unmounting, you can mount the drive to a different location using `mount -t apfs /dev/diskX /path/to/new/location`. However, macOS does not support remounting drives to a different location directly through `diskutil` or `mount` commands without some form of workaround or third-party software.

For example, if you want to remount a drive to a specific directory, you might need to use a symbolic link or a third-party tool like `bindfs` or `nullfs`, which is not included in a standard macOS build but can be built from source.

It is important to note that macOS does not allow hard linking directories in the default filesystem (APFS), which was possible in HFS+ before macOS Mojave.

Mount & Unmount Drives from the Command Line in Mac OS X

# steps

Sure! Here are the steps to remount a drive to a different location on macOS:

## Step 1: Identify the Disk Identifier

1. Open **Terminal** (you can find it in Applications > Utilities > Terminal).
    
2. Run the following command to list all connected disks and their identifiers:
    
    ```
    diskutil list 
    ```
    

3. Identify the disk you want to remount. The identifier will look something like `/dev/diskX` (where `X` is a number).
    

## Step 2: Unmount the Disk

1. Unmount the disk using the identifier you identified in the previous step:
    
    ```
    diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskX 
    ```
    

2. Replace `diskX` with the actual identifier of your disk.
    

## Step 3: Create a New Mount Point

1. Create a new directory where you want to mount the disk:
    
    ```
    sudo mkdir /path/to/new/location 
    ```
    

2. Replace `/path/to/new/location` with the actual path where you want to mount the disk.
    

## Step 4: Mount the Disk to the New Location

1. Mount the disk to the new location:
    
    ```
    sudo mount -t apfs /dev/diskXsY /path/to/new/location 
    ```
    

2. Replace `diskXsY` with the actual identifier of the partition (e.g., `disk2s1` for the first partition on disk 2) and `/path/to/new/location` with the new mount point you created.
    

## Step 5: Verify the Mount

1. Verify that the disk is mounted to the new location:
    
    ```
    df -h 
    ```
    

2. This command will list all mounted filesystems and their mount points. Look for your new mount point to ensure the disk is correctly mounted.
    

## Optional: Use Symbolic Links

If you frequently need to switch the mount point, you can create a symbolic link to the new location:

1. Create a symbolic link:
    
    ```
    ln -s /path/to/new/location /path/to/symlink 
    ```
    

2. Replace `/path/to/symlink` with the path where you want the symbolic link to be created.
    

## Example

Here is a complete example to remount a disk from `/Volumes/MyDrive` to `/mnt/MyDrive`:

1. List disks:
    
    ```
    diskutil list 
    ```
    

Output might show:

```
/dev/disk2 (external, physical):
   #:                       TYPE NAME                    SIZE       IDENTIFIER
   0:      GUID_partition_scheme                        *1.0 TB     disk2
   1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1
   2:                 Apple_APFS MyDrive                 1.0 TB     disk2s2 
```

- Unmount the disk:
    
    ```
    diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk2 
    ```
    

- Create a new mount point:
    
    ```
    sudo mkdir /mnt/MyDrive 
    ```
    

- Mount the disk to the new location:
    
    ```
    sudo mount -t apfs /dev/disk2s2 /mnt/MyDrive 
    ```
    

- Verify the mount:
    
    ```
    df -h 
    ```
    

By following these steps, you should be able to remount your disk to a different location on macOS.

    - Note the identifier of the disk you want to remount. It will look something like `/dev/diskXsY`, where `X` is the disk number and `Y` is the partition number.
        

## Step 2: Unmount the Disk

1. **Unmount the Disk:**

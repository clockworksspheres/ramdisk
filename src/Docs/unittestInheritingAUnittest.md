## Python unittest Inheritance

In Python, a test class can inherit from a generic test class, but the base class should not inherit from `unittest.TestCase` itself. Instead, the derived classes should inherit from both the base class and `unittest.TestCase`. This approach allows the sharing of common test logic while ensuring that the test runner can identify and execute the tests.

For example, you can structure your tests as follows:

``` python
class MyBaseTest:
    def common_setup(self):
        # Setup code that is common to all tests
        pass

    def common_teardown(self):
        # Teardown code that is common to all tests
        pass

class MyTestCase(MyBaseTest, unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        super().common_setup()

    def tearDown(self):
        super().common_teardown()

    def test_something(self):
        # Test code
        pass 
```

Alternatively, you can use a mixin class that contains the common test methods, and then have your test classes inherit from both the mixin and `unittest.TestCase`:

``` python
class CommonTestMixin:
    def test_common(self):
        # Common test code
        pass

class MyTestCase(CommonTestMixin, unittest.TestCase):
    def test_specific(self):
        # Specific test code
        pass 
```

It's important to ensure that the base class does not inherit from `unittest.TestCase` to avoid pytest attempting to find tests inside it and issuing warnings if none can be found.

If you want to skip the base class tests, you can raise a `unittest.SkipTest` exception in the `setUpClass` method of the base class:

``` python
class MyBaseTest(unittest.TestCase):
    @classmethod
    def setUpClass(cls):
        if cls is MyBaseTest:
            raise unittest.SkipTest("Skip MyBaseTest tests, it's a base class")
        super(MyBaseTest, cls).setUpClass() 
```

This ensures that the base class tests are not executed directly.

In summary, while you can use inheritance to share common test logic, the base class should not inherit from `unittest.TestCase` directly to avoid issues with test discovery.

# classes at two levels

Certainly! If you want to structure your tests with classes at two levels, you can use a combination of base classes and derived test classes. This allows you to share common setup, teardown, and test methods across multiple test cases. Here's an example to illustrate this:

## Base Class for Common Setup and Teardown

``` python
import unittest

class BaseTest:
    def common_setup(self):
        # Common setup code
        print("Common setup")

    def common_teardown(self):
        # Common teardown code
        print("Common teardown") 
```

## Intermediate Base Class for Shared Logic

``` python
class IntermediateTest(BaseTest):
    def intermediate_setup(self):
        self.common_setup()
        # Additional setup specific to this level
        print("Intermediate setup")

    def intermediate_teardown(self):
        # Additional teardown specific to this level
        print("Intermediate teardown")
        self.common_teardown() 
```

## Derived Test Classes

``` python
class MyTestCase1(IntermediateTest, unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.intermediate_setup()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.intermediate_teardown()

    def test_something1(self):
        print("Running test_something1")
        self.assertTrue(True)

class MyTestCase2(IntermediateTest, unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.intermediate_setup()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.intermediate_teardown()

    def test_something2(self):
        print("Running test_something2")
        self.assertTrue(True) 
```

## Explanation

1. **BaseTest**: This is the top-level base class that contains common setup and teardown methods.
    
2. **IntermediateTest**: This class inherits from `BaseTest` and adds additional setup and teardown methods specific to a higher level of abstraction.
    
3. **MyTestCase1 and MyTestCase2**: These are the actual test classes that inherit from `IntermediateTest` and `unittest.TestCase`. They override the `setUp` and `tearDown` methods to call the intermediate setup and teardown methods.
    

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the `unittest` module:

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main() 
```

When you run this script, the output will show the setup and teardown messages for each test, demonstrating the inheritance and method overriding:

``` python
Common setup
Intermediate setup
Running test_something1
Intermediate teardown
Common teardown
.
Common setup
Intermediate setup
Running test_something2
Intermediate teardown
Common teardown
. 
```

This structure allows you to maintain a clean and modular test hierarchy, making it easier to manage and extend your test cases.

# intermediate class having test cases

Found 6 relevant pages for: "python unittest intermediate class with test cases"

In Python's `unittest` framework, you can create more advanced test cases by using various features such as test fixtures, test suites, and skipping tests. Here‚Äôs an example of an intermediate-level `unittest` class with multiple test cases, including setup and teardown methods, and skipping tests:

## Example Code

``` python
import unittest

class AdvancedMathOperations:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b

class TestAdvancedMathOperations(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up the test environment before each test."""
        self.math = AdvancedMathOperations()

    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up the test environment after each test."""
        self.math = None

    def test_addition(self):
        """Test the add method."""
        result = self.math.add(5, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 8)

    def test_division(self):
        """Test the divide method with valid input."""
        result = self.math.divide(10, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_division_by_zero(self):
        """Test the divide method with zero as the divisor."""
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            self.math.divide(10, 0)

    @unittest.skip("This test is skipped for demonstration purposes")
    def test_skipped_test(self):
        """This test is skipped and will not be run."""
        self.assertTrue(False)

    def test_addition_with_negative_numbers(self):
        """Test the add method with negative numbers."""
        result = self.math.add(-5, -3)
        self.assertEqual(result, -8)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main(verbosity=2) 
```

## Explanation

1. **Test Class and Methods**:
    
    - The `TestAdvancedMathOperations` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase`.
        
    - Each test method starts with the prefix `test_` and contains assertions to verify the expected behavior of the `AdvancedMathOperations` class.
        
2. **Setup and Teardown**:
    
    - The `setUp` method is called before each test method to set up the test environment. In this case, it initializes an instance of `AdvancedMathOperations`.
        
    - The `tearDown` method is called after each test method to clean up the test environment. Here, it sets the `math` attribute to `None`.
        
3. **Assertions**:
    
    - `self.assertEqual` is used to check if the result of the `add` method is as expected.
        
    - `self.assertRaises` is used to check if a `ValueError` is raised when dividing by zero.
        
4. **Skipping Tests**:
    
    - The `@unittest.skip` decorator is used to skip the `test_skipped_test` method. This is useful for temporarily bypassing tests that are not yet ready or are known to fail.
        
5. **Running the Tests**:
    
    - The `unittest.main()` function runs all the test methods in the class. The `verbosity=2` argument provides detailed output for each test.
        

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, save the code to a file (e.g., `test_advanced_math.py`) and execute it from the command line:

```
python -m unittest test_advanced_math.py 
```

This will output the results of each test, including any skipped tests and detailed information for each assertion.

## Additional Features

- **Test Fixtures**: You can also use `setUpClass` and `tearDownClass` methods to set up and tear down resources that are shared among all test methods in the class.
    
- **Test Suites**: You can group multiple test cases into a test suite using `unittest.TestSuite`.
    
- **Test Discovery**: You can use the `unittest` command-line interface to discover and run tests automatically in a directory.
    

For more detailed information and advanced features, refer to the official `unittest` documentation.

# intermediate class has test cases

Certainly! If you want an intermediate class to contain test cases and then have derived classes that inherit from it, you can achieve this by ensuring that the intermediate class itself inherits from `unittest.TestCase`. This way, the intermediate class can contain its own test methods, and the derived classes can add additional test methods or override existing ones.

Here‚Äôs an example to illustrate this:

## Intermediate Class with Test Cases

``` python
import unittest

class AdvancedMathOperations:
    def add(self, a, b):
        return a + b

    def divide(self, a, b):
        if b == 0:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
        return a / b

class IntermediateTest(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Set up the test environment before each test."""
        self.math = AdvancedMathOperations()

    def tearDown(self):
        """Clean up the test environment after each test."""
        self.math = None

    def test_addition(self):
        """Test the add method."""
        result = self.math.add(5, 3)
        self.assertEqual(result, 8)

    def test_division(self):
        """Test the divide method with valid input."""
        result = self.math.divide(10, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_division_by_zero(self):
        """Test the divide method with zero as the divisor."""
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            self.math.divide(10, 0)

    @unittest.skip("This test is skipped for demonstration purposes")
    def test_skipped_test(self):
        """This test is skipped and will not be run."""
        self.assertTrue(False)

    def test_addition_with_negative_numbers(self):
        """Test the add method with negative numbers."""
        result = self.math.add(-5, -3)
        self.assertEqual(result, -8) 
```

## Derived Test Classes

``` python
class MyTestCase1(IntermediateTest):
    def test_specific_method1(self):
        """Test a specific method in MyTestCase1."""
        result = self.math.add(10, 5)
        self.assertEqual(result, 15)

class MyTestCase2(IntermediateTest):
    def test_specific_method2(self):
        """Test a specific method in MyTestCase2."""
        result = self.math.divide(20, 4)
        self.assertEqual(result, 5)

    def test_division_with_large_numbers(self):
        """Test the divide method with large numbers."""
        result = self.math.divide(1000000, 1000)
        self.assertEqual(result, 1000) 
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the `unittest` module:

``` python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main(verbosity=2) 
```

## Explanation

1. **IntermediateTest Class**:
    
    - The `IntermediateTest` class inherits from `unittest.TestCase` and contains common setup, teardown, and test methods.
        
    - It includes several test methods like `test_addition`, `test_division`, and `test_division_by_zero`.
        
2. **Derived Test Classes**:
    
    - `MyTestCase1` and `MyTestCase2` inherit from `IntermediateTest`.
        
    - They can add their own specific test methods or override existing ones.
        
    - The `setUp` and `tearDown` methods from the `IntermediateTest` class are automatically inherited and called for each test in the derived classes.
        
3. **Running the Tests**:
    
    - The `unittest.main(verbosity=2)` function runs all the test methods in the `IntermediateTest` class and the derived classes, providing detailed output for each test.
        

## Output

When you run the script, the output will show the results of all the test methods, including those in the `IntermediateTest` class and the derived classes. For example:

``` python
test_addition (IntermediateTest) ... ok
test_addition_with_negative_numbers (IntermediateTest) ... ok
test_division (IntermediateTest) ... ok
test_division_by_zero (IntermediateTest) ... ok
test_skipped_test (IntermediateTest) ... skipped (This test is skipped for demonstration purposes)
test_specific_method1 (MyTestCase1) ... ok
test_specific_method2 (MyTestCase2) ... ok
test_division_with_large_numbers (MyTestCase2) ... ok

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ran 7 tests in 0.001s

OK (skipped=1) 
```

This structure allows you to share common test logic and methods across multiple test classes while still allowing each derived class to have its own specific tests.

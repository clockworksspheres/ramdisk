# pyreverse UML Output

Pyreverse is a tool that generates UML diagrams from Python source code. It is part of the Pylint tool suite, which is a static code analysis tool.

To generate UML diagrams using Pyreverse, you first need to install Pylint. You can do this using pip:

``` bash
pip install pylint 
```

After installing Pylint, you can use Pyreverse to generate UML diagrams. For example, to generate a UML diagram for a project called `securedrop-export`, you would run the following command:

``` bash
pyreverse -o png -p SECUREDROP_EXPORT /path/to/securedrop-export 
```

This command will produce a Graphviz file called `classes.dot`. To convert this file into a PNG image, you need to have Graphviz installed and run the following command:

``` bash
dot -Tpng classes.dot -o securedrop_export.png 
```

Pyreverse also allows you to specify which classes to include in the diagram using the `-c` or `--class` flag. For instance, to generate a UML diagram for a specific class and its related classes, you can use:

``` bash
pyreverse -o png -c tensorgraph.optimizers.Adam -k -s 0 -p DEEPCHEM . 
```

It's important to note that Pyreverse may not produce sensible output if run on the top-level package directly. Instead, you should navigate into the submodule folder of interest and run Pyreverse from there to create a more focused UML diagram.

If you encounter issues with the output format, ensure that your project is properly packaged with `__init__.py` files in the appropriate directories. This helps Pyreverse understand the structure of your project and generate accurate diagrams.

Using pyreverse to generate UML class diagrams - Redshiftzero

# in puml or plantuml

Certainly! Pyreverse can generate UML diagrams in various formats, including PlantUML (PUML). Here's how you can use Pyreverse to generate UML diagrams in PlantUML format:

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Pylint:** First, ensure you have Pylint installed. You can install it using pip:
    
    ``` bash
    pip install pylint 
    ```
    

- **Run Pyreverse:** Use Pyreverse to generate the UML diagrams in PlantUML format. The `-o` option specifies the output format, and `puml` is the format for PlantUML.
    
    ```
    pyreverse -o puml -p PROJECT_NAME /path/to/your/project 
    ```
    

1. - `-o puml`: Specifies the output format as PlantUML.
        
    - `-p PROJECT_NAME`: Specifies the project name.
        
    - `/path/to/your/project`: The path to your project directory.
        
2. **Generate the PlantUML Diagram:** Pyreverse will generate `.puml` files in the current directory. You can then use a PlantUML tool or online service to render these files into UML diagrams.
    

## Example

Suppose you have a project named `securedrop-export` located at `/path/to/securedrop-export`. To generate PlantUML files for this project, you would run:

``` bash
pyreverse -o puml -p SECUREDROP_EXPORT /path/to/securedrop-export 
```

This command will generate `classes.puml` and `packages.puml` files in the current directory.

## Rendering the PlantUML Files

You can use various tools to render the `.puml` files into UML diagrams:

1. **Online PlantUML Editor:**
    
    - Go to an online PlantUML editor like PlantUML Live.
        
    - Copy and paste the contents of the `.puml` file into the editor.
        
    - The editor will render the UML diagram for you.
        
2. **Local PlantUML Renderer:**
    
    - You can use a local PlantUML renderer like the PlantUML plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or other IDEs.
        
    - Alternatively, you can use the command-line tool to render the diagrams:
        
    
    ``` bash
    plantuml classes.puml 
    ```
    

3. This will generate `classes.png` (or other supported formats) in the same directory.
    

## Tips

- **Project Structure:** Ensure your project is well-structured with `__init__.py` files in the appropriate directories to help Pyreverse understand the module hierarchy.
    
- **Class and Package Diagrams:** Pyreverse generates both class and package diagrams. You can specify which type of diagram you want to generate using the `-a` (all), `-c` (classes), or `-p` (packages) options.
    

By following these steps, you should be able to generate UML diagrams in PlantUML format using Pyreverse.

view puml or plantuml files

Viewing PlantUML (`.puml`) files can be done using various tools, both online and offline. Here are some of the most common methods:

## Online Tools

1. **PlantUML Live**
    
    - **Website:** PlantUML Live
        
    - **Usage:**
        
        - Go to the PlantUML Live website.
            
        - Copy and paste the contents of your `.puml` file into the text area on the left.
            
        - The UML diagram will be rendered on the right.
            
2. **PlantText**
    
    - **Website:** PlantText
        
    - **Usage:**
        
        - Go to the PlantText website.
            
        - Paste the contents of your `.puml` file into the text area.
            
        - The UML diagram will be rendered below the text area.
            

## Offline Tools

1. **PlantUML Plugin for IDEs**
    
    - **IntelliJ IDEA:**
        
        - Install the PlantUML plugin from the JetBrains Marketplace.
            
        - Open your `.puml` file in IntelliJ IDEA, and the plugin will render the diagram.
            
    - **Eclipse:**
        
        - Install the PlantUML plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.
            
        - Open your `.puml` file in Eclipse, and the plugin will render the diagram.
            
    - **Visual Studio Code:**
        
        - Install the PlantUML plugin from the Visual Studio Code Marketplace.
            
        - Open your `.puml` file in Visual Studio Code, and the plugin will render the diagram.
            
2. **Command-Line Tool**
    
    - **Installation:**
        
        - Install Graphviz and PlantUML.
            
            ```
            brew install graphviz plantuml  # On macOS with Homebrew
            sudo apt-get install graphviz plantuml  # On Ubuntu 
            ```
            

- **Usage:**
    
    - Use the `plantuml` command to generate an image from your `.puml` file.
        
        ```
        plantuml classes.puml 
        ```
        

1. - - This will generate an image file (e.g., `classes.png`) in the same directory.
            

## Example

Suppose you have a `classes.puml` file and want to view it using the command-line tool:

1. **Install PlantUML and Graphviz:**
    
    ```
    brew install graphviz plantuml  # On macOS with Homebrew
    sudo apt-get install graphviz plantuml  # On Ubuntu 
    ```
    

- **Generate the Image:**
    
    ```
    plantuml classes.puml 
    ```
    

2. **View the Image:**
    
    - The `plantuml` command will generate a `classes.png` file.
        
    - Open the `classes.png` file using any image viewer.
        

## Summary

- **Online Tools:** Use PlantUML Live or PlantText for quick and easy rendering.
    
- **IDE Plugins:** Install PlantUML plugins for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Visual Studio Code for integrated rendering within your development environment.
    
- **Command-Line Tool:** Use the `plantuml` command-line tool to generate and view UML diagrams from `.puml` files.
    

By using these tools, you can easily view and work with PlantUML files in your preferred environment.

command line used to create .puml and .plantuml files in this directory:

``` bash
$ pyreverse -o plantuml -ASmy -p ramdisk ../ramdisk/ramdisk.py
$ pyreverse -o puml -ASmy -p ramdisk ../ramdisk/ramdisk.py
```

The first command line creates the file:  classes_ramdisk.plantuml.

The second command creates the file: classes_ramdisk.puml

Depending on the support software that is installed, other file formats that pyreverse can create are:   dot, mmd and HTML.  Other file formats that may be able to be created are png, svg and jpg - whatever the 'dot' command line tool might be able to generate.

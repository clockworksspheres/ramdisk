# pyreverse UML Output

Pyreverse is a tool that generates UML diagrams from Python source code. It is part of the Pylint tool suite, which is a static code analysis tool.

To generate UML diagrams using Pyreverse, you first need to install Pylint. You can do this using pip:

``` bash
pip install pylint 
```

After installing Pylint, you can use Pyreverse to generate UML diagrams. For example, to generate a UML diagram for a project called `securedrop-export`, you would run the following command:

``` bash
pyreverse -o png -p SECUREDROP_EXPORT /path/to/securedrop-export 
```

This command will produce a Graphviz file called `classes.dot`. To convert this file into a PNG image, you need to have Graphviz installed and run the following command:

``` bash
dot -Tpng classes.dot -o securedrop_export.png 
```

Pyreverse also allows you to specify which classes to include in the diagram using the `-c` or `--class` flag. For instance, to generate a UML diagram for a specific class and its related classes, you can use:

``` bash
pyreverse -o png -c tensorgraph.optimizers.Adam -k -s 0 -p DEEPCHEM . 
```

It's important to note that Pyreverse may not produce sensible output if run on the top-level package directly. Instead, you should navigate into the submodule folder of interest and run Pyreverse from there to create a more focused UML diagram.

If you encounter issues with the output format, ensure that your project is properly packaged with `__init__.py` files in the appropriate directories. This helps Pyreverse understand the structure of your project and generate accurate diagrams.

# in puml or plantuml

Certainly! Pyreverse can generate UML diagrams in various formats, including PlantUML (PUML). Here's how you can use Pyreverse to generate UML diagrams in PlantUML format:

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Install Pylint:** First, ensure you have Pylint installed. You can install it using pip:
    
    ``` bash
    pip install pylint 
    ```
    

- **Run Pyreverse:** Use Pyreverse to generate the UML diagrams in PlantUML format. The `-o` option specifies the output format, and `puml` is the format for PlantUML.
    
    ```
    pyreverse -o puml -p PROJECT_NAME /path/to/your/project 
    ```
    

1. - `-o puml`: Specifies the output format as PlantUML.
        
    - `-p PROJECT_NAME`: Specifies the project name.
        
    - `/path/to/your/project`: The path to your project directory.
        
2. **Generate the PlantUML Diagram:** Pyreverse will generate `.puml` files in the current directory. You can then use a PlantUML tool or online service to render these files into UML diagrams.
    

## Example

Suppose you have a project named `securedrop-export` located at `/path/to/securedrop-export`. To generate PlantUML files for this project, you would run:

``` bash
pyreverse -o puml -p SECUREDROP_EXPORT /path/to/securedrop-export 
```

This command will generate `classes.puml` and `packages.puml` files in the current directory.

## Rendering the PlantUML Files

You can use various tools to render the `.puml` files into UML diagrams:

1. **Online PlantUML Editor:**
    
    - Go to an online PlantUML editor like PlantUML Live.
        
    - Copy and paste the contents of the `.puml` file into the editor.
        
    - The editor will render the UML diagram for you.
        
2. **Local PlantUML Renderer:**
    
    - You can use a local PlantUML renderer like the PlantUML plugin for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or other IDEs.
        
    - Alternatively, you can use the command-line tool to render the diagrams:
        
    
    ``` bash
    plantuml classes.puml 
    ```
    

3. This will generate `classes.png` (or other supported formats) in the same directory.
    

## Tips

- **Project Structure:** Ensure your project is well-structured with `__init__.py` files in the appropriate directories to help Pyreverse understand the module hierarchy.
    
- **Class and Package Diagrams:** Pyreverse generates both class and package diagrams. You can specify which type of diagram you want to generate using the `-a` (all), `-c` (classes), or `-p` (packages) options.
    

By following these steps, you should be able to generate UML diagrams in PlantUML format using Pyreverse.

# generate uml from source code with doxygen

Found 9 relevant pages for: "Doxygen generate UML from source code"

To generate UML diagrams from source code using Doxygen, you need to configure Doxygen to use the Graphviz tool, which is responsible for generating the diagrams. Here are the steps to set up Doxygen for UML generation:

1. **Install Doxygen and Graphviz**:
    
    - On Ubuntu, you can install Doxygen and Graphviz using the following commands:
        
        ``` bash
        sudo apt-get install doxygen doxygen-gui
        sudo apt-get install graphviz graphviz-doc 
        ```
        

- **Generate a Doxygen Configuration File**:
    
    - Navigate to your project directory and generate a default Doxygen configuration file:
        
        ``` bash
        cd /path/to/your/project
        doxygen -g 
        ```
        
- - This will create a `Doxyfile` in your project directory.
        
- **Configure the Doxyfile**:
    
    - Open the `Doxyfile` in a text editor and set the following options:
        
        ```
        EXTRACT_ALL = YES
        HAVE_DOT = YES
        CLASS_DIAGRAMS = YES
        HIDE_UNDOC_RELATIONS = NO
        CLASS_GRAPH = YES
        COLLABORATION_GRAPH = YES
        UML_LOOK = YES
        UML_LIMIT_NUM_FIELDS = 50
        TEMPLATE_RELATIONS = YES
        DOT_GRAPH_MAX_NODES = 100
        MAX_DOT_GRAPH_DEPTH = 0
        DOT_TRANSPARENT = YES 
        ```
        

- If you want to generate SVG diagrams, which are scalable and can be zoomed and panned, set:
    
    ```
    DOT_IMAGE_FORMAT = svg
    INTERACTIVE_SVG = YES 
    ```
    

- **Run Doxygen**:
    
    - After configuring the `Doxyfile`, run Doxygen to generate the documentation and UML diagrams:

# Set Up For Building on Linux

Each type of linux OS is slightly different, with different package managers and software repositories, so here are links to OS specific setup.

## Software required for building the project

* python (not the latest version as pyside6 doesn't work with it)
* git
* obsidian (not available on arm systems)
* favorite editor (project prefers positron)

## Useful software to consider installing

* drawio (not available on arm systems)
* brave browser (or other favorite browser)
* slack or other 'community software' like pidgin or discord (for OS specific communities)
* vym (if available)
* umbrello
* pytest
* meld
* qtcreator
* zotero (not available on arm systems)

## Set up git to connect to github with ssh

Should be close to the same on every linux OS.

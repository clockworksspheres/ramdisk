# Support libraries for this project

Many shared with other clockworksspheres and other projects.

## logging related

* log_message.py (older library giving some examples of using python logging facilities.)
* loggers.py  ( Current library that rely's on the python logging functionality )

## Running commands

* run_commands - class RunWith (manages consistent use of command processing across the project.  More stable that running individual subprocess calls inconsistently across the project.)

## Collecting information about the system

* envoronment.py ( currently only for \*nix systems  - collecting both hardware and operating system and minimal software components of the system )

## Filtering what OS's are supported

* CheckApplicable.py ( this could be relevent to the whole projects, or specific pieces/libraries that support the project )
